# A Walk in the Park

The prettiest text adventure you'll ever play.

## About

Just another ordinary day, you decide to take a walk in the park. In classic
text adventure tradition, you are given free reign to explore the world around
you, and interact with everything you can see. The story unfolds naturally as a
work of interactive fiction. "A Walk in the Park" is a beautifully orchestrated
tale of peace and quiet.
